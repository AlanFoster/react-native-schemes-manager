XCode environments without the stress. Use XCode schemes with React Native without pulling your hair out.

[![Supported by Thinkmill](https://thinkmill.github.io/badge/heart.svg)](http://thinkmill.com.au/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=react-native-schemes-manager)

If your app has multiple environments, you'd probably like to be able to manage these the way native developers have been doing for years, XCode schemes and build configurations.

By default, React Native doesn't handle these particularly well, and the ability to launch dev tools or run in debug mode is impacted. This package fixes these problems.

## Installation

```
yarn add --dev react-native-schemes-manager
```
or
```
npm install --save-dev react-native-schemes-manager
```

Once the package is installed in your project, you just need to configure it by adding a `schemes` section to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  /* etc */
  "schemes": {
      "Debug": ["Staging", "Preflight"]
  }
}
```

This configuration will copy the "Debug" build configuration to "Staging" and "Preflight" build configurations in all your dependent library projects.

## What Then?

The package will automatically run this script to do two things on `postinstall`:
- Swap its own version of react-native-xcode.sh in instead of the stock on that assumes all debug schemes are named 'Debug'.
- Add your build configurations to all library xcode projects. 

This means you shouldn't need to do anything further to make this work than the above.

## Running Manually

You can run the two parts of this package on demand by running either:

- `react-native-schemes-manager fix-libraries`: Adds your build configurations to all library xcode projects.
- `react-native-schemes-manager fix-script`: Swaps a schemes aware build script in instead of the stock react native one.

The best way to do this is add to your `package.json` scripts section like so:

```json
{
  "name": "your-awesome-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  /* etc */
  "scripts": {
      "fix-libraries": "react-native-schemes-manager fix-libraries",
      "fix-script": "react-native-schemes-manager fix-script"
  }
}
```

You can then `yarn run fix-libraries` or `npm run fix-libraries` which will run the script.

I wanted a pure Node build pipeline and I didn't want to have to muck around with per package configuration.
